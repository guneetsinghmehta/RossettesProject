1 save ND2 files to tiff
2 make the algo modular
3 Test voting on zero, one , two 3 and 4
4 ctFIRE - change to mask the fibers with -1 and +1
  Figure out a way to calculate fiber angles 
5 

Architecture
1 classifier 1-voting
Input - image name
Output - metadata VotingData - field1 - slices
	            field2 - weights of each slice 
  		    field3 - voted mask
	            field4 - individual maskss

2 classifier - inputs- FireData
  1. Image name, path 
  2. metadata from previous 

  3. internally derived ctFIRE

  Output - metadata2 fireData- fields
  1. list of fibers
  2. vertices of fibers
  3. mask made from ellipse, tolerance level
  4. angle data of all fibers with respect to boundary
